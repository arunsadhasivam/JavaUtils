8%3 = 2 because 8 = 3 + 3 + 2 = 2(3) + 2. Once you take out the 3's, you have 2 left.

9%3 = 0 because 9 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 3(3) + 0. Once you take out the 3's, you have 0 left.

1%2 = 1 because 1 = 1 + 0(2). There are no 2's, so you're just left with 1.

12%100 = 12 because 12 = 12 + 0(100),Take out your multiples of 100 and you're left with 12.
